# I'm Jack McShane

> I have just finished the final semester of my M.S. in Computer Science degree at Indiana University, where I have focused on embedded systems and software design.  I received a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University Northwest during my undergraduate studies. The transition from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science was challenging, but has also been an endeavor that I have found interesting throughout! While my focus for my degree has been embedded software development, my interests span much further. I have also spent time studying machine learning, network programming and security, and system administration for linux systems.

> The repositories that I have showcased under this account document my progress as a programmer and contain a mix of work I have done for my degree as well as some personal programming projects.
