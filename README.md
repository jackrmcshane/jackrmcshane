# I'm Jack McShane

> I am in the final semester of my Masters of Computer Science degree at Indiana University.  For my undergraduate, I received a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University Northwest. The transition from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science was challenging, but also has been an endeavor that I have found enthralling throughout! My focus is in the field is embedded systems and low level programming, but my interests span much further. I have also spent time learning about topics like machine learning, network programming and security, and system administration for linux systems.

## What I'm Learning About Now
- **Embedded Systems Design** - how am I going about learning this stuff and stuff?
- **Network Programming** - stuff and stuff
- **Network Security** - stuff and stuff
- **Linux System Administration** - stuff and stuff

## Ongoing Projects

Below is a table of my ongoing projects each paired with a description of what the project entails.
